# FlexJoystick
**FlexJoystick** is a plain JavaScript ES6 class that is used to add interactable joysticks to the websites.

The class supports 3 types of joysticks:
1. Classic round Joysticks;
2. Wide joysticks;
3. Long joysticks;

This is the default Joysticks design you can expect:

**Important note**: I'm new to JavaScript and this is my first proper JS project. I'm absolutely not an expert in bose JS and web development. Contributions of all sorts are welcome!

This project is open to use and improve by anyone.
